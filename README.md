> **Stop re-explaining your project to your AI agent every morning.**

`lazy-harness` is the missing scaffolding around AI coding agents like [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code): persistent memory across sessions, isolated profiles for personal/work/client setups, a cross-platform hook engine, SQLite-backed monitoring, a knowledge directory, and a unified scheduler — all driven by one TOML file.

It does not fork or proxy the agent. It wraps the environment around it.

## Why

AI coding agents ship as a chat interface and a file tool. That's enough for a demo. It's not enough for 8 hours a day across three projects. You hit predictable walls:

- **Session amnesia.** Every conversation starts from zero. You re-paste the same context every morning.
- **One global config.** Personal experiments, employer code, client work and side projects all share `~/.claude/`. There is no clean switch.
- **No observability.** What did last week cost? Which sessions touched the repo? You can't say.
- **Knowledge is write-only.** What you learn in a session dies when the window closes.
- **Recurring jobs are yours to build.** Pre-compact summaries, weekly reviews, nightly re-indexes — you write the cron entries per platform, by hand.

`lazy-harness` is the scripts, the schedulers and the discipline, packaged as a Python tool.

## Features

| Feature | What it does | Try it |
|---|---|---|
| **Profiles** | Isolate `personal`, `work`, `client` — each with its own `CLAUDE.md`, `settings.json`, skills and knowledge. Switch by directory or env var. | `lh profile add work --config-dir ~/.claude-work --roots ~/repos/work` |
| **Hooks** | Cross-platform hook engine with built-ins for session-start context injection, pre-compact summaries, session export and compound-loop enforcement. Bring your own via `config.toml`. | `lh hooks list` |
| **Monitoring** | SQLite-backed metrics on every session — duration, tokens, tools, cost. Ten built-in dashboard views. | `lh status sessions --period week` |
| **Knowledge** | Filesystem knowledge directory for sessions and distilled learnings, optionally indexed by [QMD](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) for semantic search. | `lh knowledge sync && lh knowledge embed` |
| **Scheduler** | One interface over launchd, systemd and cron. Declare jobs in TOML; the harness writes the native unit files. | `lh scheduler install` |
| **Migration** | Take an existing Claude Code setup and convert it in place — dry-run gate, full backup, one-command rollback. | `lh migrate --dry-run` |

A typical `~/.config/lazy-harness/config.toml` is small:

```toml
[profiles.personal]
config_dir = "~/.claude-personal"
roots = ["~/code/personal"]

[profiles.work]
config_dir = "~/.claude-work"
roots = ["~/code/work"]

[hooks.SessionStart]
context-inject = { enabled = true }

[hooks.PreCompact]
summarize = { enabled = true }

[scheduler.jobs.metrics-ingest]
schedule = "*/15 * * * *"
command = "lh metrics ingest"
```

## The memory problem (and how it's solved)

The single feature most users notice on day one is that the agent stops forgetting. On top of the agent's built-in `CLAUDE.md`, `lazy-harness` ships a **five-layer memory stack** ([ADR-027](https://github.com/lazynet/lazy-harness/blob/main/specs/adrs/027-memory-stack-overview.md)). Two layers are file-based and shipped by the framework itself; three are best-of-breed external tools that `lh` detects, configures and (where applicable) wires into the agent automatically via [ADR-024](https://github.com/lazynet/lazy-harness/blob/main/specs/adrs/024-mcp-server-orchestration.md).

| Layer | Backend | Provided by | What it answers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Curated semantic** | `MEMORY.md` (file, ≤ 200 lines) | shipped — `<config_dir>/projects/<slug>/memory/` | "What rules and patterns govern this project?" |
| **Distilled episodic** | `decisions.jsonl` / `failures.jsonl` (append-only) | shipped — written by the compound-loop worker | "What did we decide? What broke and why?" |
| **Raw episodic** | [Engram](https://github.com/Gentleman-Programming/engram) — SQLite + FTS5, MCP server | external CLI, auto-wired when installed | "What did we do in this project last week, and when?" |
| **Searchable semantic** | [QMD](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) — BM25 + vectors, MCP server | external CLI, auto-wired when installed | "Where did I see this pattern across all my notes and repos?" |
| **Structural** | [Graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify) — tree-sitter call graph (`graphify-out/graph.json`) | external CLI, detected and exposed via `lh doctor` and the `/graphify` skill | "What calls X? What does this module look like?" |

The layers map to three classic memory archetypes: **episodic** (distilled + raw), **semantic** (curated + searchable) and **structural** (the code-graph index). User-facing rule: pick the layer first, then the tool — `lh doctor` and the `lh config` wizards group their output the same way.

Before `lazy-harness`, the first 5 minutes of every session were context reconstruction. After, they're work.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) — the agent being wrapped
- `git`

### Install

```bash
uv tool install git+https://github.com/lazynet/lazy-harness
lh --version
lh doctor      # verify environment is sane
```

### First run

Pick the entry point that matches your machine:

```bash
# A — Fresh machine, no Claude Code state yet
lh init

# B — Existing Claude Code setup (always dry-run first)
lh migrate --dry-run
lh migrate
```

`lh init` refuses to run when existing Claude Code state is present. `lh migrate` requires a recent dry-run before writing, takes a full backup, and supports `lh migrate --rollback`.

### See it working

```bash
lh selftest                   # end-to-end validation
lh status                     # overview dashboard
lh status sessions --period week
lh hooks list
```

The full walkthrough lives in the [getting-started guide](https://lazynet.github.io/lazy-harness/getting-started/install/).

## How it works

`lazy-harness` keeps a hard boundary between framework code (upgraded with `uv tool upgrade`) and your personal harness content (versioned with your dotfiles). The framework reads from your config and **deploys** it into the agent's directories via symlinks and generated settings — you never edit anything inside the framework package.

## Is this for you?

| You will probably love it if... | You probably do not need it if... |
|---|---|
| You use an AI coding agent for hours a day | You open the agent occasionally to ask a one-off question |
| You juggle multiple repos, employers or clients | You only have one project and one global config |
| You want session metrics and per-project history | You don't care what last week cost |
| You're comfortable in a terminal and editing TOML | You want a GUI |
| You run macOS or Linux | You're on Windows (not supported yet) |

`lazy-harness` is opinionated about *plumbing*, not about *workflow*. Every default is overridable; every feature is opt-in via `config.toml`. It is not a Claude Code fork, not a chat wrapper, not an MCP server.
